                After Vladimir Lenin's statue was brought down at Belonia College Square in Agartala following the BJP's victory in the Tripura Assembly election, there have been reports of vandalism on statues across the country.
                A post in BJP's National Secretary H.Raja's Facebook Page against Periyar statues in Tamil Nadu triggered Statewide protests. Mr. Raja subsequently removed the post and expressed regret, but the issue refused to die down.
